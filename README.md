# Next.js + Prisma Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) and set up to use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM for database management.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install all project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
````

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the application by modifying the file at `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Database Setup with Prisma

This project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database access. Follow these steps to set up your database.

### 1. Define Your Data Model

Edit your data model in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

### 2. Push the Schema to the Database

Run the following command to apply the schema to your database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 3. Generate Prisma Client

After pushing the schema, generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Your Prisma client will now be available in your project for querying the database.

## API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed at:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

This endpoint is defined in `pages/index.tsx`.

Files in the `pages/api` directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and not as React pages.

## Font Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family by Vercel.
